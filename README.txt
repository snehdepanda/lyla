This project was completed as part of the course ELEC_ENG 327 offered at Northwestern University, under the guidance of Professor Ilya Mikhelson. The purpose of the project was to develop an embedded tool to improve the communication between users who primarily communicate in American Sign-Language (ASL), and those who are able to speak in English. The solution combines principles of edge-computing and embedded programming in C++, as well as various APIs. A more detailed description of the solution is provided in report.pdf. There are various branches of the solution available for testing various components; however, the S3_test branch is the one used for the demo of the project.
